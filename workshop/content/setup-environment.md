This workshop environment relies on Kubeapps having already been separately installed into the Kubernetes cluster. It relies on Kubeapps having been installed into the `kubeapps` namespace. It is expected that the Kubeapps deployment has the new style web interface enabled.

To test that Kubeapps is installed and available, click on the **Kubeapps** dashboard tab.

```dashboard:open-dashboard
name: Kubeapps
```

You should be presented with the login page for Kubeapps.
