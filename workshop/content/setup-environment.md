This workshop environment relies on Kubeapps having already been separately installed into the Kubernetes cluster. It relies on Kubeapps having been installed into the `kubeapps` namespace and that Kubeapps login has not been integrated with any SSO product.

To test that Kubeapps is installed and available, click on the **Kubeapps** dashboard tab.

```dashboard:open-dashboard
name: Kubeapps
```

You should be presented with the login page for Kubeapps.
